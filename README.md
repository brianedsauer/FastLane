# FastLane Integration Guide

##Overview


FastLane is called via a simple Javascript file included in the `<HEAD>` tag on the page to execute Rubicon Project Marketplace Auctions asynchronously prior to calling the primary Ad Server. The Ad Server can then be accurately informed of available demand from the Marketplace and therefore make better yield optimization decisions about which line item to render for any/all ad slots on any given page.
